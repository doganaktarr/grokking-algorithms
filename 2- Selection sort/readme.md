<h3>Recap from Chapter 2</h3><br>

• Your computer’s memory is like a giant set of drawers.<br>

• When you want to store multiple elements, use an array or a list.<br>

• With an array, all your elements are stored right next to each other.<br>

• With a list, elements are strewn all over, and one element stores<br>

the address of the next one.<br>

• Arrays allow fast reads.<br>

• Linked lists allow fast inserts and deletes.<br>

• All elements in the array should be the same type (all ints, all doubles, and so on).
