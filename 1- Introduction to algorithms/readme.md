<h3>Recap from Chapter 1</h3><br>

• Binary search is a lot faster than simple search.<br>

• O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster once the list of items you’re searching through grows.<br>

• Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds.<br>

• Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm.<br>

• Algorithm times are written in Big O notation.<br>
